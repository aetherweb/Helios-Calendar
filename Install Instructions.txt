Helios Calendar 1.1
[www.HeliosCalendar.com]
_____________________________________________
Installation Instructions

NOTE: If your site already has a root index.php file or an admin directory do not upload the Helios root index.php file and rename the Helios admin directory. If you upload the entire zip you may overwrite your existing admin or root page. This could break your site. Also for users upgrading Helios you do not need to recreate your globals.php file, you can skip step 3 and delete the globals_dist.php file.

1) Upload the contents of the Helios ZIP to your webserver.
2) Create Your Helios database & database user account (user must have create permissions)
3) Rename globals_dist.php to globals.php and configure your Helios settings (/events/includes/globals_dist.php) by editing your globals.php file in a text editor.
4) Run the Helios web setup (You will be prompted for this by trying to open Helios in your browser)
